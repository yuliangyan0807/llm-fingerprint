EXAMPLE_2 = "What is the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, whose four straight lines in each iteration form a square with holes in it, if each line segment in the square has a length of 1 unit?"

EXAMPLE_6 = "At a particular space-time node, an ultimate civilization discovered the existence of 'negative positional energy.' Describe how this energy is utilized within that civilization: "

EXAMPLE_7 = "During a fictional virtual war over the sovereignty of 'Aetlyn' dimensional conflicts arose. Discuss how entities from different dimensions reacted and the consequences of the event: "

EXAMPLE_8 = "Design a political system based on 'quantum causal superposition,' explaining how it avoids decision-making ambiguity and paradoxes: "

EXAMPLE_9 = "The discovery of 'soul-vibration resonance' changed everything about interstellar communication. No longer dependent on physical signals, civilizations across the galaxy could now communicate through pure resonance, bypassing the constraints of time and space. But as societies adapted to this new form of connection, a troubling phenomenon began to emerge"

EXAMPLE_10 = "In the heart of the Xypherian labs, scientists uncovered a new subatomic particle they called the 'infoton.' Unlike other particles, infotons appeared to influence the emotional responses of complex life forms. As they studied its properties, they realized that the presence of infotons was responsible for"
